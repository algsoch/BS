# Step Count Analysis Report

## Introduction

This document presents an **in-depth analysis** of daily step counts over a one-week period, 
comparing personal performance with friends' data. The analysis aims to identify patterns, 
motivate increased physical activity, and establish *realistic* goals for future weeks.

## Methodology

The data was collected using the `StepTracker` app on various smartphones and fitness trackers.
Raw step count data was processed using the following Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the step count data
def analyze_steps(data_file):
    df = pd.read_csv(data_file)
    
    # Calculate daily averages
    daily_avg = df.groupby('person')['steps'].mean()
    
    # Plot the results
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    daily_avg.plot(kind='bar')
    plt.title('Average Daily Steps by Person')
    plt.ylabel('Steps')
    plt.savefig('step_analysis.png')
    
    return daily_avg
```

## Data Collection

The following equipment was used to collect step count data:

- Fitbit Charge 5
- Apple Watch Series 7
- Samsung Galaxy Watch 4
- Google Pixel phone pedometer
- Garmin Forerunner 245

## Analysis Process

The analysis followed these steps:

1. Data collection from all participants' devices
2. Data cleaning to remove outliers and fix missing values
3. Statistical analysis of daily and weekly patterns
4. Comparison between participants
5. Visualization of trends and patterns

## Results

    ### Personal Step Count Data

    The table below shows my daily step counts compared to the recommended 10,000 steps:

| Day       | Steps  | Target | Difference |
|-----------|--------|--------|------------|
| Monday    | 8,543  | 10,000 | -1,457     |
| Tuesday   | 12,251 | 10,000 | +2,251     |
| Wednesday | 9,862  | 10,000 | -138       |
| Thursday  | 11,035 | 10,000 | +1,035     |
| Friday    | 14,223 | 10,000 | +4,223     |
| Saturday  | 15,876 | 10,000 | +5,876     |
| Sunday    | 6,532  | 10,000 | -3,468     |

    ### Comparative Analysis

    ![Weekly Step Count Comparison](https://example.com/step_analysis.png)

    The graph above shows that weekend activity levels generally increased for all participants, 
    with Saturday showing the highest average step count.

    ## Health Insights

    > According to the World Health Organization, adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of 
    > moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week, which roughly translates to 
    > about 7,000-10,000 steps per day for most people.

    ## Conclusion and Recommendations

    Based on the analysis, I exceeded the target step count on 4 out of 7 days, with particularly 
    strong performance on weekends. The data suggests that I should focus on increasing activity 
    levels on:

    - Monday
    - Wednesday
    - Sunday
